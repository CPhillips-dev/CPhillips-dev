## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

What I am up to at the moment

ðŸ”­ 
Currently, I am in the design phase of my new portfolio website: cphillips.dev@github.io. I plan to display all my projects on this site.
I plan to incorporate React.js and Express.js in some fashion for this endeavor.

ðŸŒ±
I am diving deeper into C++ through cengage learning.

ðŸ‘¯
I am open to collaborating on a new AR / VR app. I plan to use Unreal Engine for DevOps development. Furthermore, I plan to contribute to a few open-source projects this year.

ðŸ¤”
Iâ€™m looking for help learning Google Kubernetes Engine, AI / ML

[?]
Ask me about my passion for learning and innate ability to keep up with the latest technologies and frameworks.

Fun fact: If you have never failed, then you never stepped outside your comfort zone.
